# Homepage
**Hompage** is the first pages I've created in my life.Here you will find a few sentences obout me, my hobbies and plans for the future. I started creating the website by writing the **HTML** code. Then i added styles in **CSS**. When I got to know how **Java Script** works, I added a function that changes the background color of the page. Below you can see a gif of my website and link.
